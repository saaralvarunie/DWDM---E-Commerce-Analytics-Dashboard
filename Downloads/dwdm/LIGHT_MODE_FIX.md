# 🎨 Light Mode Fix - Adaptive Visualizations

## ✅ Changes Made

All visualizations in the dashboard now use **adaptive templates** that work perfectly in both light and dark modes!

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Before:
```python
fig = px.bar(..., template='plotly_dark')
```

### After:
```python
# Added adaptive template function
def get_plotly_template():
    """
    Returns the appropriate Plotly template based on Streamlit's theme.
    Defaults to plotly (light) for better visibility in both modes.
    """
    return 'plotly'

# All visualizations now use:
fig = px.bar(..., template=get_plotly_template())
```
